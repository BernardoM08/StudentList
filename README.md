# StudentList 2

2nd version of the Student List project. I used the sample code from the discussions tab on canvas, and based the rest of my code off of that. I created a separate method to print all of the students. And I created a while loop in the main method that runs through takes in a in, and matches it with multiple if statements to choose whether the user wants to add a student, print the list of students, or quit. I still need to add a method to delete a student from the vector.
